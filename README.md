# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to find out whether paid reviews result in five star reviews. Through the Amazon Vine program, sellers can send products to Vine members to review. Vine members are selected by Amazon on an "invite-only" basis and should offer sellers more confidence about the reviews they get on their products.

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The percentage of Vine reviews that were 5 stars was 42.34%. The percentage of non Vine reviews that were 5 stars was 49.92%.

## Summary

Looking at the results, there is no distinctive positive bias for reviews in the Vine program. 5 star reviews in the Vine program was 42.34%, while 49.92% of non Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

An additional analysis that can be done to suppor the argument that Vine reviews have a positive bias for 5 star reviews is to only analyze reviews that are verified purchases. By keeping all other criteria constant, verified purchases increased 5 star reviews in the Vine program to 60%, while non Vine 5 star reviews remained relatively the same at 49.90%.
